# Amazon_price_alert_project

This project automates the process of tracking product prices on Amazon. It uses web scraping with BeautifulSoup to extract the product's current price and title. If the price drops below a specified threshold, an email alert is sent using Python's smtplib, notifying the user of the price change. This tool is useful for monitoring deals and getting notifications when it's the best time to make a purchase.
